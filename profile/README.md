## SRBL
Our research goal is to analyze the design and dynamics of biological systems and transform them into robotic/mechatronic systems for human life. We are interested in bio-inspired design of soft robots and development of novel manufacturing methods for multi-material smart structures.


## Research Vision
We envision our research being a foundation to establish a design and manufacturing methodology for developing soft robots by implementing biological sensing and actuation mechanisms.
